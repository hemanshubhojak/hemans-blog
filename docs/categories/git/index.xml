      <description>While using GitFlow, it is a good practice to keep your feature branch in sync with the develop branch to make merging easy.
I do the following to keep my feature branch in sync with develop.
git checkout develop #if you don&amp;#39;t have it already git checkout feature/x #if you don&amp;#39;t have it already git pull --all git merge develop You can also do a rebase instead of merge.</description>
